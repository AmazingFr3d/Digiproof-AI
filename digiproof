I leveraged the RandomForestClassifier, a robust and versatile algorithm from the scikit-learn library in Python, to construct a predictive model. This model examines a range of attributes from both job descriptions, such as required skills, salary, job location, and years of experience, and candidate profiles, including their prior work experience and skill sets.\n","\n","For the data preparation and manipulation phases, I utilised the powerful pandas library. This tool facilitated a systematic approach to organising, cleaning, and transforming the raw datasets, which is crucial for ensuring high-quality input for the model. The meticulous data preparation process significantly enhanced the modelâ€™s accuracy during training and evaluation.\n","\n","Given the constraints of the project timeline, the dataset employed in this project is synthetic, generated through the code snippet provided below. This synthetic dataset serves as a stand-in, allowing for preliminary testing and validation. Once a real dataset becomes available, it can be seamlessly integrated into the model for future enhancements and more realistic performance assessments."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"3db3e4cd","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-08T00:34:54.788911Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-08T00:34:54.78846Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-08T00:34:54.806037Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-08T00:34:54.804661Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.026578,"end_time":"2025-05-08T00:34:54.807841","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-05-08T00:34:54.781263","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["%%script false --no-raise-error # Remove this line to run this cell \n","!pip install -U scikit-learn imbalanced-learn\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"ff47a768","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-08T00:34:54.820046Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-08T00:34:54.81976Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-08T00:34:59.158817Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-08T00:34:59.157465Z"},"papermill":{"duration":4.347432,"end_time":"2025-05-08T00:34:59.160621","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-05-08T00:34:54.813189","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np # linear algebra\n","import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n","import random\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n","from sklearn.utils import resample\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline, FeatureUnion\n","from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n","from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\n","import joblib"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"42cd8a63","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00533,"end_time":"2025-05-08T00:34:59.171152","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-05-08T00:34:59.165822","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Dataset Generation\n","I will generates some random data set for candodates and jobs with the code bellow as time to not parmit me to gather real world data.
